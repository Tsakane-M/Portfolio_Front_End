        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
        I am a young black male who comes from Zimbabwe. I started my studies at UCT as an Electrical Engineering student. With time I realised
that I was not cut out to be an Electrical Engineer, instead, I enjoyed the few Computer Science courses we took in the first year of the degree. At that time
I was fresh from high school and had never coded before but understanding the
concepts came naturally to me.

        At the back of my mind, I was always jealous of the
students studying Computer Science. I would occasionally watch Python tutorials
on Youtube. A combined lack of passion for EE and financial problems plus my love
for Computer Science made me decide to change to a B.Sc in Computer Science
after 3 years of study in the EE degree. I am very passionate about what I do now,
I believe coding was meant for me and I am very excited to pursue this journey.
